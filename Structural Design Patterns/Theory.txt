Structural Design Pattern

Adapter Design Pattern
-> The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible classes to work together by converting the
interface of one class into another interface that the client expects.

✔ Simple Meaning:
Adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

✔ Real-Life Analogy:

A mobile charger is an adapter:
Wall socket (AC) → Adapter → Phone (needs DC)

A USB-to-Type-C converter:
USB port → Adapter → Type-C phone

Why Do We Need an Adapter?
-> You want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match the expected interface.
-> You want to integrate third-party or legacy code into your system.
-> You want to follow the Open/Closed Principle — avoid modifying existing classes.
================================================================================================
Bridge Design Pattern
-> The Bridge Pattern is used to separate (decouple) an abstraction from its implementation so
that both can vary independently.
📌 In simple words:
Bridge = Abstraction + Implementation (decoupled).
You separate what you do from how you do it.

Why Bridge Pattern?
-> You want to avoid a large number of classes due to combinations

Example:
Shapes (Circle, Square)
Colors (Red, Blue)
Without bridge → 4 classes:
RedCircle, BlueCircle, RedSquare, BlueSquare
Adding more colors causes class explosion.
With bridge →
Abstraction: Shape
Implementation: Color
Only 2 hierarchies → combinations handled at runtime.

================================================================================================
Composite Design Pattern
-> The Composite Pattern is used to represent hierarchical tree structures where individual
objects and groups of objects are treated the same way.
-> Composite lets you treat a single object and a group of objects uniformly.
(Leaf and Composite behave the same for the client)

Why Use Composite Pattern?
-> Use it when your system represents part-whole hierarchies, such as:
Folder → contains files and subfolders
UI components → Button, TextBox, Panels
Organization chart → Employee, Manager
Menu → MenuItem, MenuCategory
AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)
===============================================================================================
What is the Decorator Pattern?
-> The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to
individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same
class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Core Concept
-> The pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
Decorators mirror the type of the components they decorate (they implement the same interface
or inherit from the same abstract class), but they add or override behavior.

Key Participants
-> Component - Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them
dynamically
-> ConcreteComponent - Defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached
-> Decorator - Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that
conforms to Component's interface
-> ConcreteDecorator - Adds responsibilities to the component
