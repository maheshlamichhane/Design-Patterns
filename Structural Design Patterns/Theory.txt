Structural Design Pattern

Adapter Design Pattern
-> The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible classes to work together by converting the
interface of one class into another interface that the client expects.

✔ Simple Meaning:
Adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

✔ Real-Life Analogy:

A mobile charger is an adapter:
Wall socket (AC) → Adapter → Phone (needs DC)

A USB-to-Type-C converter:
USB port → Adapter → Type-C phone

Why Do We Need an Adapter?
-> You want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match the expected interface.
-> You want to integrate third-party or legacy code into your system.
-> You want to follow the Open/Closed Principle — avoid modifying existing classes.
================================================================================================
Bridge Design Pattern
-> The Bridge Pattern is used to separate (decouple) an abstraction from its implementation so
that both can vary independently.
📌 In simple words:
Bridge = Abstraction + Implementation (decoupled).
You separate what you do from how you do it.

Why Bridge Pattern?
-> You want to avoid a large number of classes due to combinations

Example:
Shapes (Circle, Square)
Colors (Red, Blue)
Without bridge → 4 classes:
RedCircle, BlueCircle, RedSquare, BlueSquare
Adding more colors causes class explosion.
With bridge →
Abstraction: Shape
Implementation: Color
Only 2 hierarchies → combinations handled at runtime.
