Design Patterns
-> Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide
templates for how to structure your code so it becomes more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.
-> They are not code you copy-paste but best-practice approaches to solving recurring design
challenges.

Why Design Patterns?
-> Improve code reusability
-> Increase maintainability
-> Encourage clean architecture
-> Reduce coupling between components
-> Make code easier to understand for other developers
